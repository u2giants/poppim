# Data Access Guide — POP Creations / Spruce Line Platform

This document gives a second AI session the direct data-access details needed to independently inspect D1 and the interview data.

**Read first:** `FUTURE_SESSION_START_HERE.md` for the higher-level truths, caveats, and unresolved modeling questions. This file is the access reference, not the full business synthesis.

## What This Company Does

Licensed and generic home decor products. Designed in-house, manufactured in China, imported and sold to major U.S. retail chains (Burlington, TJX, Ross, Hobby Lobby, Walmart, etc.). 75% of products are licensed (Disney, Marvel, Warner Bros, etc.) and require licensor approval of designs AND physical samples before mass production can begin. The other 25% are non-licensed ("Spruce Line") with a simpler approval path.

Full business intelligence, pipeline details, SLA targets, and requirements are in **BUSINESS_INTELLIGENCE.md** in the same repo.

## Key Tables and How to Use Them

### `products` — Start here, but do not stop here.
9,069 rows. Denormalized and enriched.

**Important caution:** this table is useful, but it is not a perfect one-row-per-business-product truth layer. The imported ClickUp data mixes:

- parent project / presentation cards
- child SKU execution work
- support tasks

Use `tasks` when you need to validate hierarchy, parent/child structure, or whether a record is project-like versus SKU-like.

**Always add `WHERE is_internal = 0`** to exclude the internal software dev space.

Key columns:
| Column | Type | Notes |
|--------|------|-------|
| id | TEXT | ClickUp task ID |
| name | TEXT | SKU name with structured code prefix |
| licensor | TEXT | Disney, Marvel, WB, Star Wars, DC Comics, etc. |
| retailer | TEXT | Burlington, TJX, Ross, Walmart, etc. |
| product_category | TEXT | Wall, Storage, Desktop, etc. (sparse — only 57 rows populated) |
| stage_name | TEXT | Current pipeline stage (clean name) |
| stage_category | TEXT | Ideation / Concept / Design / Pre-Production / Production / Fulfillment / Complete / Admin |
| stage_order | INT | Numeric order (5–609). Higher = further along |
| status | TEXT | Raw ClickUp status string |
| space_name | TEXT | "POP Creations" or "Spruce Line" |
| list_name | TEXT | Which ClickUp list |
| is_active | INT | 1 = currently open, 0 = closed |
| is_internal | INT | 1 = designflow/dev space (exclude these) |
| days_in_pipeline | REAL | Days since task was created |
| days_since_last_update | REAL | Days since last change |
| is_overdue | INT | 1 if past due_date |
| concept_revisions | INT | Number of concept revision cycles |
| packaging_revisions | INT | Number of packaging revision cycles |
| sample_rounds | INT | Number of sample rounds |
| milestone_concept_approved | INT | 1 if reached concept approval |
| milestone_sample_approved | INT | 1 if sample approved |
| milestone_art_complete | INT | 1 if art marked complete |
| milestone_pi_approved | INT | 1 if PI approval reached |
| milestone_tech_pack_checked | INT | 1 if tech pack checked |
| assignee_ids | TEXT | JSON array of user IDs |
| comment_approvals | INT | Approval signals in comments |
| comment_revisions | INT | Revision requests in comments |

**Sample query — active POP Creations products by stage:**
```sql
SELECT stage_name, stage_category, COUNT(*) as cnt
FROM products
WHERE is_internal = 0 AND is_active = 1 AND space_name = 'POP Creations'
GROUP BY stage_name

### `status_transitions` — Every status change ever recorded
17,978 rows. Important caveat: **most rows have `from_status = NULL`** because they were bulk-imported from the snapshot. Only ~473 rows have real from→to transitions (from the live webhook period, Mar 30–May 18, 2026).

## Suggested Starting Queries

**Before deep analysis, validate the hierarchy directly:**
```sql
SELECT
  l.name AS list_name,
  COUNT(*) AS total_tasks,
  SUM(CASE WHEN t.parent_task_id IS NULL OR t.parent_task_id = '' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS parent_cards,
  SUM(CASE WHEN t.parent_task_id IS NOT NULL AND t.parent_task_id != '' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS child_tasks
FROM tasks t
LEFT JOIN lists l ON l.id = t.list_id
GROUP BY l.name
ORDER BY total_tasks DESC;
```

**Understand the current active pipeline:**
```sql
SELECT stage_name, stage_category, stage_order, COUNT(*) as cnt
FROM products WHERE is_internal=0 AND is_active=1
GROUP BY stage_name ORDER BY stage_order
```

**Licensor breakdown with revision rates:**
```sql
SELECT licensor, COUNT(*) as products, AVG(concept_revisions) as avg_revisions
FROM products WHERE is_internal=0 AND licensor IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY licensor ORDER BY products DESC
```

**Most active users in webhook period:**
```sql
SELECT user_name, COUNT(*) as events FROM events
WHERE user_name IS NOT NULL GROUP BY user_name ORDER BY events DESC
```

**Read all answered interview content:**
```sql
SELECT respondent, topic, question, answer FROM interview_questions
WHERE status='answered' ORDER BY id
```

**Products stuck in Concept Approved (no next step):**
```sql
SELECT name, licensor, days_in_pipeline, days_since_last_update
FROM products WHERE stage_name='Concept Approved' AND is_active=1
ORDER BY days_since_last_update DESC LIMIT 20
```
